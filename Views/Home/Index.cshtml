<p>This website is meant to be used as a resource for lawmakers in Utah to better understand the causes and other relevant
    information concerning motor vehicle collisions in Utah. Through carefully analyzing over 200,000 car accidents, in the state
    of Utah between the years of 2016 and 2019, the following have been determind to be the top 10 most impactful factors influencing
    the severity of a car crash (not in order):
    <ul>
        <li>Involvement of a motorcyclist</li>
        <li>Involvement of a pedestrian</li>
        <li>A crash resulting in the car being overturned</li>
        <li>Involvement of a bicyclist</li>
        <li>Driver/passengers being unrestrained</li>

        <li>Drivers being under the influence (DUI)</li>
        <li>Night/dark conditions</li>
        <li>Departure from roadway</li>
        <li>A crash involving multiple vehicles</li>
    </ul>
